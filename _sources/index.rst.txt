correctionlib
=============

Introduction
------------
The purpose of this library is to provide a well-structured JSON data format for a
wide variety of ad-hoc correction factors encountered in a typical HEP analysis and
a companion evaluation tool suitable for use in C++ and python programs.
Here we restrict our definition of correction factors to a class of functions with
scalar inputs that produce a scalar output.
